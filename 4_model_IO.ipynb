On a clean surface or in a large mixing bowl, pour the flour and create a well in the center.\\n2. Crack the eggs into the well and add the salt.\\n3. Using a fork or your fingers, gradually mix the eggs and salt into the flour, incorporating a little bit at a time.\\n4. Once the dough starts to come together, knead it with your hands until it forms a smooth and elastic ball. If the dough feels too dry, you can add a little water, one tablespoon at a time, until it reaches the desired consistency.\\n5. Once the dough is formed, cover it with a clean kitchen towel or plastic wrap and let it rest for about 30 minutes. This will allow the gluten to relax and make the dough easier to work with.\\n6. After resting, divide the dough into smaller portions. Take one portion and flatten it with your hands or a rolling pin until it's about 1/4 inch thick.\\n7. If you have a pasta machine, you can use it to roll out the dough into thin sheets. Start with the widest setting and gradually decrease the thickness until you reach the desired thickness for your pasta.\\n8. If you don't have a pasta machine, you can use a rolling pin to roll out the dough as thin as possible. Dust the dough with flour as needed to prevent sticking.\\n9. Once the dough is rolled out, you can cut it into your desired pasta shape. For example, you can cut it into thin strips for spaghetti or wider strips for fettuccine. You can also use a pasta machine attachment to cut the dough into different shapes like penne or farfalle.\\n10. As you cut the pasta, dust it with flour to prevent sticking and lay it out on a clean surface or hang it on a pasta drying rack.\\n11.

      "- 1 cup of rice\n",
      "- 1 cup of nuruk (Korean fermentation starter)\n",
      "- 8 cups of water\n",
      "- 1 tablespoon of yeast\n",
      "- 1 tablespoon of sugar (optional)\n",
      "\n",
      "Instructions:\n",
      "1. Rinse the rice thoroughly until the water runs clear.\n",
      "2. Soak the rice in water for about 1 hour, then drain.\n",
      "3. Steam the rice until it becomes soft and fully cooked.\n",
      "4. Let the cooked rice cool down to room temperature.\n",
      "5. In a large container, combine the cooled rice, nuruk, and water.\n",
      "6. Mix well until the ingredients are fully incorporated.\n",
      "7. Cover the container with a clean cloth or plastic wrap and let it ferment for about 7-10 days at room temperature.\n",
      "8. After the fermentation period, strain the mixture through a cheesecloth or fine mesh strainer to remove any solids.\n",
      "9. Dissolve the yeast and sugar (if using) in a small amount of warm water, then add it to the strained liquid.\n",
      "10. Transfer the liquid to airtight bottles or jars, leaving some space at the top for expansion during fermentation.\n",
      "11. Seal the bottles or jars tightly and let them ferment for an additional 2-3 weeks at room temperature.\n",
      "12. After the fermentation process is complete, refrigerate the soju before serving.\n",
      "13. Serve chilled and enjoy responsibly!\n",
      "\n",
      "Note: The fermentation time may vary depending on the temperature and other factors. It is important to monitor the fermentation process and adjust accordingly. Here is a basic recipe for making bread:\n",
      "\n",
      "Ingredients:\n",
      "- 4 cups all-purpose flour\n",
      "- 2 teaspoons active dry yeast\n",
      "- 2 teaspoons salt\n",
      "- 2 tablespoons sugar\n",
      "- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil\n",
      "- 1 ½ cups warm water (around 110°F/43°C)\n",
      "\n",
      "Instructions:\n",
      "1. In a large mixing bowl, combine the warm water and sugar. Stir until the sugar is dissolved.\n",
      "2. Sprinkle the yeast over the water and let it sit for about 5 minutes until it becomes foamy.\n",
      "3. Add the flour, salt, and vegetable oil to the bowl. Mix well until a dough forms.\n",
      "4. Transfer the dough onto a floured surface and knead for about 10 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic. You can also use a stand mixer with a dough hook attachment for this step.\n",
      "5. Place the dough in a greased bowl and cover it with a clean kitchen towel. Let it rise in a warm place for about 1-2 hours or until it doubles in size.\n",
      "6. Once the dough has risen, punch it down to release any air bubbles. Transfer it to a lightly floured surface and shape it into a loaf or desired shape.\n",
      "7. Place the shaped dough onto a greased or parchment-lined baking sheet. Cover it with a towel and let it rise for another 30-45 minutes.\n",
      "8. Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C) while the dough is rising.\n",
      "9. Optional: You can brush the top of the dough with an egg wash or milk for a shiny crust.\n",
      "10. Bake the bread in the preheated oven for about 30-35 minutes or until it turns golden brown and sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom.\n",
      "11. Remove the bread from the oven and let it cool on a wire rack before slicing and serving.\n",
